# Travelies

## Description

Travelies is a fictional website that serves as an online platform for adventure enthusiasts to explore and book various travel experiences. Designed to provide a seamless user experience, Travelies offers a range of features and functionalities to enhance the journey of its users. Through the implementation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I developed a visually appealing and user-friendly website prototype for Travelies. The website consists of multiple pages, including Home, About Us, Start Adventure, Rent, and more, each designed to showcase the available travel options and provide detailed information about each adventure. Users can conveniently browse through the website, view adventure details, and make bookings. The main objective of Travelies is to improve the online presence and customer experience, offering adventure seekers a platform to discover and embark on their next thrilling experience.
